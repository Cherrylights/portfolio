      "Holm is a conceptual design project for a sneaker store with a minimalism design style. The idea is to create a stylish online store that is able to provide a simple and intuitive user experience for customers. The website is still an ongoing project  and by far only finishes the front end part. The next step is to make it talk to a backend JSON API in order to manage inventory and also integrate with a payment API."

In the project, light intensity will be determined by video fed to the software, sent through Art-Net over ethernet or USB to a DMX interface, and then to the LED dimmer. The LED dimmer will take the intensity value depending on their allowed addresses and dim the LED strip connected to the corresponding output by fast-switching the voltage provided by the power supply."

    info:
      "Temple is a digital project of documenting and presenting Chinese historic buildings in a new way. The initial idea behind this project is to digitalize a fair amount of ancient temples in China by using assorted technologies like photogrammetry and virtual reality. The project contains two tiers - the backend and the frontend.  The backend layer is the data layer which contains detailed information about each building that have been documented. This includes building’s 3D mesh, texture data, range data and point cloud data etc. These data collection have potential value in many aspects such as research studies and future restoration. Meanwhile, a part of the collected data such as 3D mesh, 360 images and videos can be used to create the presentation layer of the project - a VR/AR mobile app.  In the app, users are able to explore the building interactively by watching the 360 video about the interior of the building or observing the building’s 3D model under the AR mode. The ultimate goal of this project is trying to draw people’s attention on those valuable historic buildings and finally raising their protection awareness of those relics."
